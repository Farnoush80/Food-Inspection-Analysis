# Inspection

Food safety inspections are a means by which the government ensures that food is clean and safe for consumers. A food premises inspection report is a key tool to ensure that food safety standards are met. There are three types of inspections: regular inspections, reinspections, and enforcement inspections. Finally, inspectors make the decision whether an inspection passes with no action, requires a reinspection, or schedules a regular inspection within 12 months, indicating 'enforcement inspection required.'
In this project, beyond general statistical and descriptive analysis, each of the three inspection types has been analysed to provide a better understanding of inspectors' and food premises owners' responses."
