# Food Premises Inspection


# Description



Food safety inspections are a means by which the government ensures that food is clean and safe for consumers. A food premises inspection report is a key tool to ensure that food safety standards are met. 
There are three types of inspections: regular inspections, reinspections, and enforcement inspections. Inspection score is the main feature for making decision also inspection description along with violation-description provide valuable information to illustrate why these decisions have been made.
Finally, inspectors make the decision whether an inspection passes with no action, requires a reinspection, or schedules a regular inspection within 12 months, indicating 'enforcement inspection required.' In this project, beyond general statistical and descriptive analysis, each of the three inspection types has been analysed to provide a better understanding of inspectors' and food premises owners' responses to inspection, common reasons for failed inspections, and valuable information about the patterns inspectors follow when making decisions."

# Conclusion 

In 96% of regular inspections, five specific codes consistently play a pivotal role in determining the inspection outcome. However, in scheduled regular inspections within a 12-month period and 'enforcement inspections,' other codes become influential in the decision-making process. 

In instances of successful inspections and regular inspections within a 12-month period, the mean inspection scores closely align. Evidently, certain codes contribute significantly to the outcome of passing or failing an inspection. In the context of enforcement inspections, both the inspection score and specific codes exert significant influence on the decision-making process."
